# HR-Analytics-Dashboard_PowerBI
I've crafted an interactive HR Analytics dashboard with Power BI, utilizing a dummy dataset available on Kaggle. The primary objective is to gain insights into attrition. The dashboard features filters based on department and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as employee count, attrition numbers, attrition rate, average salary, years at the company, and attrition by gender.The outcomes derived from the analysis include attrition rate categorized by education, attrition patterns based on age groups, and insights into attrition concerning salary levels.
